#
# Pass in a domain id and delete the domain, including any credentials which
# belong to that domain. See the Domains page in SAS Environment Manager, or
# use listdomains.py, to get a list of domains including the id of each
# domain. This pyviyatool can delete encryption domains, which SAS Environment
# Manager will not allow you to delete (at the time this tool was developed).
#
# Usage:
# deletedomain.py --id id [--quiet]
